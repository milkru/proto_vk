# About
Rendering engine prototype made with `Vulkan 1.3` which can render billions of triangles in just a couple of milliseconds. Code is written using a [simpler C++ coding style](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b). Project is written for the `C++20` standard and `x64` system. Currently the code is tested only on `Windows`, using `MSVC` (Visual Studio) and `MINGW` (Visual Studio Code) compilers. `Linux` is not completely supported at the moment, but it should be easy to port, since all third party libraries are cross platform.

## Installation
This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) as a build tool. Since the project is built using `Vulkan`, the latest [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com) is required.

## Requirements
Make sure that your graphics card supports listed Vulkan features, use VulkanSDK version 1.3.280.0 and make sure you have updated graphics card driver.
